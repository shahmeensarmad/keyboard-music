## Key Features: 
- 🎹  Four notes of a keyboard: CDEF  
- 🎹  Uses a piezo and tuning of frequencies based off sensor value range  
- Note: when replicating this project, you may have to change the sensor value range at which notes are played. Base this off of the values printed on the serial monitor
